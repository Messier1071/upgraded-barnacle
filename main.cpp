/*
todo 1 - create encryptionTable
todo 2   - criar classe EncryptionEngine (uses encryptionTable) to encrypt and decrypt
todo 3 - encryptionTable must receive the key from Main through Engine
todo 4 - regenerate method in engine to recreate table with or without new key
todo 5 - text to encrypt and decrypt must go through cypher (encryptionEngine is private)
todo 6 - table generation method is free (lets get creative)
todo 7 - Menu (pretty if possible)
